     Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting that uses electronic<br> means to either aid or take care of casting and counting ballots.<br><br>

Depending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use standalone <br>electronic voting machines (also called EVM) or computers connected<br> to the Internet (online voting).<br>
     
     In general, two main types of e-voting can be identified:<br>
    <ul> <li><h5>e-voting which is physically supervised by representatives<br> of governmental or independent electoral authorities </h5></li>
<li><h5>remote e-voting via the Internet (also called i-voting)<br> where the voter submits his or her vote electronically<br>to the election authorities, from any location.</h5></li><br>
